🌾 Crop Production Prediction
A machine learning-based project to forecast crop production using FAOSTAT agricultural data. This project utilizes data science and ML techniques to improve agricultural planning and decision-making.

📌 Project Objective
To build a regression model that accurately predicts crop production (in tons) based on factors such as:

Area harvested (in hectares)

Yield (kg/ha)

Year

📈 Business Use Cases
Food Security & Planning: Help governments plan food supplies.

Policy Making: Support development of subsidies, insurance, and relief programs.

Supply Chain Optimization: Guide logistics based on production forecasts.

Price Forecasting: Aid farmers/traders in choosing optimal selling times.

Precision Farming: Recommend crops based on productivity.

Agro-Tech Tools: Enable startups to build farmer-centric solutions.
